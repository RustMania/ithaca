# ITHACA - toy payment engine

## Description

Ithaca is the toy payment engine that reads a transaction feed formatted as CSV, and performs operations on user's balances.
Why ITHACA? Ithaca is smallest but marvellous greek island located in Ionian see. It has been identified as the home of the mythological hero Odysseus.
This fact brings me a lot of various warm feelings.

## Motivation

The reason for writing this program is to demonstrate the usage of patterns and idioms of Rust programming language. The library uses asynchronous features of the language , as well as it employs  Tokio framework.
My previous experience with the subject dated by 2019 was different that one from today. The compiler and the language have been improved, the Tokio framework has matured and become de-facto standard for other crates.

## Logical model

The payment engine supports following transactions:

* DEPOSIT  - add an amount to the account
* WITHDRAW  - withdraw an amount 
* DISPUTE  - lock same exact amount previously DEPOSITED into its "held" state
* RESOLVE - unlock an amount previously DISPUTED back to the available state
* CHARGEBACK - withdraw an amount previously DISPUTED. The operation leads to account locking so that any following transactions with this account will be rejected 

The uniqueness of a transaction is guaranteed by using the domain of 32 bit unsigned numbers for the ID. 
The user( client ) ID domain is limited to 16 bit unsigned numbers. The user has single asset ( e.g. single currency ). If the engine encounters user which has no balance yet, the empty balance will be created for him/her.

The engine checks for various conditions before changing the balance. For example, negative or zero amounts are rejected. 

## Implementation details

Few things need to be mentioned:
* Balances and transaction history are contained in structures shareable by threads and are provisioned with read/write locking mechanism.
* Amounts are expressed in decimal numbers with max 4 digits after comma.
* The program uses error-chain crate to deliver consistent error processing.
